# Scheduler

Scheduler is a PWA made for METU NCC course scheduling and exam tracking.

It is basically a different version of the CET systems student schedule and midterm/final exam search condensed into a modern one page app.

## Installation

-   To start all you need is a package manager like npm, yarn, or pnpm.

-   And then you clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UmutSen2662/scheduler.git
cd scheduler
```

-   After that you can use your package managers install command to finish setting up:

```bash
npm install
```

## Development

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at http://localhost:5173 by default.

## Build

To create a production-ready build, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

The build output will be located in the docs directory because I am currently serving it using github pages.
